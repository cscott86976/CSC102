        security components in the design.
        2. Install, configure and test security hardware and software tools with supporting documentation such as port scanners,

        analysis and assessment.
        4. Create a policy or procedure that addresses events such as: a disaster recovery plan, a business continuity plan, an 
        incident response policy, an acceptable usage document, an information security policy, a physical security policy, 
        assessments or troubleshooting procedures.
        5. Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning legal and ethical best practices and mandated requirements 
        that pertain to information security.
        6. Research, document, test and evaluate several current industry information security-based threats, risks, malicious
